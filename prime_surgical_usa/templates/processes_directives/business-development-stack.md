# business_development_stack():

**Layer 0** – Focus on Intangibles – specific to the business development role. Thoughtful anticipatory discussion from leadership is key. The primary objective is to identify the optimal traits to tease out in the hiring process. (My opinions - not intended to be exhaustive):

- __Optimism__ – _the role of business development often requires grit. You need to learn how to hear “no” without decaying confidence. Emotional regulation will be required. Default to optimism is a solid foundation (“Learned Optimism” – Martin Seligman, & Concept of “Urgent Optimism” - Jane McGonigal)_

- __Emotional Intelligence__ – _Where ‘default optimistic’ is my leading indicator for resiliency, emotional intelligence (EQ) is the leading attribute for skill. If there is any “art” to sales, it exists here – where one must dance around the nuance of the individual opportunity._

- __Aptitude For Learning__ – _Strong knowledge of the product is paramount to individualizing the value proposition to each respective prospect. The role needs to be able to quickly take in new information, and adjust their supporting framework accordingly_

**Layer 1** – Information, Training, and Progress – focus throughout, but especially early. The team needs to have quality information to refer to. The training needs to be applicable to their day-to-day, and they need to know they’re advancing towards mastery. Here, leadership begins reinforcing the vision of the company. Mutually accepted objectives are set, and leadership begins grafting the association between the role of business development and the organization’s ability to achieve the mission. Culture is critical.

**Layer 2** – Processes & Flow – Here, the emphasis is on optimizing the workflow to maximize productivity and efficiency. The goal is to create seamless processes that facilitate the flow of information, enable smooth collaboration, and minimize unnecessary work disruptions. Effective tools and software solutions should be integrated into the workflow to automate tasks where possible and to capture important data for further analysis.

**Layer 3** – Dashboard – A comprehensive and user-friendly dashboard is vital for data-driven decision making. It provides real-time insights into business development efforts and allows for continuous monitoring and evaluation of performance against set objectives. The dashboard should be seamlessly integrated into the workflow, making it easy for team members and management to access and interpret data.

- _“In God we trust, all others must bring data” – W. Edwards Deming_

**Layer 4** – Incentives – An effective incentive program helps motivate team members to reach their highest potential. The incentives must be aligned with the overall business objectives and should promote collaboration among team members. Autonomy, mastery, and purpose, as described in Daniel Pink's "Drive," are intrinsic motivators that can contribute to job satisfaction and employee engagement, leading to increased productivity and better results.

- **Autonomy** – _People need to feel they have flexibility to express themselves in the role. Leadership must assert that individuals should experiment, within the confines of the role. An overlying collective goal will have been clearly outlined, but one is set to seek success in their own way._

- **Mastery** – _People need to feel they are constantly growing. Job design can foster this by continually focusing on personal development. Set the expectation that they should be getting better (framing matters), and make sure they feel they have the resources to do so._

- **Purpose** – _People need to feel that what they are working on has meaning. This is where the concept of “vision” is critical to culture. Leadership needs to constantly reinforce how effort leads to common objectives. Celebrate wins, reinforce the vision._

**Layer 5** – Valid Feedback – Throughout the stack, a culture of genuine feedback needs to be cultivated. Without it, the integrity of all other layers of the stack are challenged. I believe in a strong correlation between strength of the information and strength of the decision. This layer promotes a culture of openness and honest communication. Regular feedback is vital for continuous improvement, and it helps in identifying and addressing issues at an early stage. It also enables team members to understand their performance against expectations, fostering a culture of accountability and continuous learning.

- _“Feedback is the breakfast of champions” – Ken Blanchard_

**Layer 6** – Collaborate, Implement, Measure, Repeat - This layer is about ongoing evaluation and improvement. It underscores the need for regular collaboration, implementation of learned insights, measurement of results, and continuous refinement of strategies and processes. It's about fostering a culture of agility and adaptability, where changes and improvements are embraced for the betterment of the team and the business.

# SALES OPTICS

Together, these components can serve as a comprehensive framework for designing and managing an effective business development team. It emphasizes clear communication, ongoing feedback, data-driven decision-making, systematic tracking of opportunities, focused targeting of potential clients, performance standards, and ambitious yet achievable goal-setting.

**Upstream Feedback:** Encourage a culture where feedback flows freely and is highly valued. Upstream feedback – from employees to leaders – is crucial for the growth of the team and the organization. This feedback could be related to processes, strategies, leadership styles, or any other aspect that affects the performance and morale of the team. Leadership must ensure this feedback is actively sought, received with grace, and acted upon to improve existing conditions.

**Sales Dashboard:** A well-designed sales dashboard is key to monitor business development efforts. This includes tracking sales, assessing performance metrics, and identifying trends or patterns. The dashboard should offer actionable insights to guide resource allocation, forecast sales, and develop effective sales strategies. Regular review and interpretation of this data can significantly contribute to decision-making processes.

**Opportunity Tracker - CRM:** Keeping track of potential business opportunities is vital. An effective CRM system can help with the organization, tracking, and management of leads and potential clients. It enables the team to systematically approach each opportunity, maintain relevant data for future strategies, and ensures no opportunity slips through the cracks.

**Target Matrix:** A clearly defined target matrix helps focus business development efforts. This involves identifying the target audience or potential clients, outlining strategies to engage them, and earmarking necessary resources to achieve this. It sets a clear path for the team, minimizing wasted effort and maximizing the probability of securing new business.

**Set Standards:** Establishing and communicating clear performance standards is essential. These standards serve as a benchmark, guiding team members towards the expected level of performance. They're not about limiting potential but about providing a baseline that ensures consistent quality of work.

**Goals:** Goal-setting is a critical part of any business development strategy. Goals should be challenging yet achievable, pushing the team to stretch beyond their comfort zone. They should tie into the broader strategic vision for the team, motivating them to work towards shared objectives. Create the connection between how acheiveing the set goals unlock the vision that leadership has set forth.
