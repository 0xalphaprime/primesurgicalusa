**Prompting** - The concept of prompting is the most important aspect of using chatGPT. The prompt is the first sentence or two that you use to start the conversation. A constructive prompt will frame the question for the LLM to optimize performance. Fundamentally, all an LLM does is make predictons based on the prompt. The more specific the prompt, the more specific the response.
