        Surgical Interventions in Cardiac Diseases: CABG, Valve Replacements,
        Transcatheter Interventions
      </h3>
      <p>
        The realm of cardiac surgery has evolved significantly, with a spectrum
        of surgical interventions available to manage and treat various cardiac
        diseases. In this module, we will delve into three pivotal procedures:
        Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), Valve Replacements, and
        Transcatheter Interventions.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we covered in the anatomy module, the heart is a complex system
        composed of two pumps. It uses coordinated electrical impulses to more
        blood through the pressure-valve system. Ischemic diseases require
        intervention of the pipes, or blood vessels. Valvular diseases require
        intervention of one of the 4 main the valves (aortic and mitral
        primarily).
      </p>
      <p>
        As the procedural protocol has evolved throughout the last few decades,
        surgeons have often partnered with industry to develop the tools and
        methods to perform specifed aspects of the procedures. In this section I
        will highlight some of the key concepts in cardiac surgery and the
        products that are used to perform the procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a percursor to the next section, where we will explore our
        portfolio, and get more into the specifics, strategy, and prefrence
        profiles of the surgeons and teams we work with.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Objective</strong>: CABG aims to restore blood flow to
              ischemic myocardium by bypassing obstructed coronary arteries.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Procedure</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Autologous vessels, usually the internal mammary artery or
                  saphenous vein, are harvested.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The patient is often placed on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The harvested vessel is grafted to the aorta and the site past
                  the obstruction, bypassing the stenotic areas.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Indications</strong>: Significant obstruction in the
              coronary arteries, particularly in patients with left main
              coronary disease or severe triple-vessel disease.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Outcomes</strong>: CABG has been shown to improve survival
              and quality of life in individuals with advanced coronary artery
              disease.<br />

            <li>
              <strong>Objective</strong>: To replace dysfunctional heart valves
              that are either stenotic or regurgitant, restoring normal
              hemodynamics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Procedure</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Mechanical Valves</strong>: Known for durability but
                  require lifelong anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic
                  events.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Bioprosthetic Valves</strong>: Have lower
                  thrombogenicity but are less durable than mechanical valves.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Valve Repair</strong>: Involves various techniques to
                  repair the native valve, such as commissurotomy, annuloplasty,
                  or chordal reconstruction.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Indications</strong>: Severe valvular stenosis or
              regurgitation affecting the patient's quality of life and cardiac
              function.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Outcomes</strong>: Valve replacements significantly
              alleviate symptoms and improve survival, although they may require
              re-operation over time, especially bioprosthetic valves.<br />

        Key Concept: <strong>Suturing in Surgical Practice</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Suturing, a fundamental skill in surgical practice, involves using a
        needle and thread to close incisions, repair tissues, and facilitate
        healing. In the context of cardiothoracic surgery, suturing is pivotal
        in ensuring the stability and integrity of repaired structures, such as
        vessels, heart valves, and tissue layers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="../../static/img/suturing_techniques.png"
          alt="Suturing Techniques"
        />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Types of Sutures</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Absorbable vs. Non-absorbable:</strong> Absorbable sutures are
          broken down by the body over time, while non-absorbable ones remain
          indefinitely and may require removal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Monofilament vs. Multifilament:</strong> Monofilament sutures
          consist of a single thread, while multifilament sutures are braided.
          Monofilament sutures are less prone to infection, while multifilament
          sutures provide better knot security.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Natural vs. Synthetic:</strong> Sutures can be made from
          natural materials, like silk or catgut, or from synthetic materials,
          such as polypropylene or nylon.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><img src="../../static/img/suture_types.png" alt="sutures" /></p>
      <p><strong>Suture Sizing</strong></p>
      <p>
        <img src="../../static/img/suture_sizing.png" alt="suture sizing" />
      </p>
      <p>
        With suture Size 0 is the baseline. Moving to the left (1, 2, 3, etc.)
        the suture gets larger. Moving to the right (1-0, 2-0, 3-0, etc.) the
        suture gets smaller.
      </p>
      <p>
        For reference size 0 represents the "stay" sutures used for pericardial
        retraction, or the closure of large skin incisions. Size 2-0 is
        typically used to sew in boprosthetic valves. Size 7-0 is used to do a
        distal anastomosis in CABG. Size 5-0 or 6-0 is typically used to do a
        proximal anaostomosis in CABG.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same sizing methodology works for the stainless steel sternal wires
        we will cover thoughout this curriculum. The most common size for
        sternal wire used is size 6, which is on the other side of the spectrum.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Key Suturing Techniques</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Simple Interrupted Suture:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Usage:</strong> Widely used for closing incisions and
              wound edges.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Process:</strong> Individual stitches are placed and tied
              separately.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advantages:</strong> If one suture fails, the others
              remain intact.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Running or Continuous Suture:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Usage:</strong> Useful for long incisions where speed is
              crucial.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Process:</strong> A single suture thread is used to sew
              along the length of the wound without tying individual knots.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advantages:</strong> Quick and uses less suture material.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> If the suture breaks, the entire
              line may fail.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Mattress Suture:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Usage:</strong> Employed to approximate wound edges and
              distribute tension.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Process:</strong> The suture is passed perpendicular to
              the wound, encompassing larger amounts of tissue.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advantages:</strong> Reduces tension across the wound and
              promotes healing.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        Key Concept: <strong>Anatomy of the Sternum</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        The sternum, also known as the breastbone, is a flat bone that forms the
        anterior portion of the chest wall. It is a T-shaped bone that is
        divided into three parts: the manubrium, the body, and the xiphoid
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="../../static/img/sternum_anterior_overview.png"
          alt="stenrum"
        />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Manubrium</strong></p>
      <p>
        The manubrium is the broad, superior segment of the sternum. It
        articulates with the clavicles at the sternoclavicular joints and with
        the costal cartilages of the first pair of ribs. The manubrium also has
        a number of important landmarks, including the jugular notch, which is
        located at the superior margin of the manubrium and lies between the two
        clavicles.
      </p>

        />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Body</strong></p>
      <p>
        The body of the sternum is the middle portion of the bone. It
        articulates with the costal cartilages of the second to seventh pairs of
        ribs. The body of the sternum is also the site of attachment for a
        number of muscles, including the pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, and
        sternocleidomastoid muscles.
      </p>

        />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Xiphoid process</strong></p>
      <p>
        The xiphoid process is the narrow, inferior segment of the sternum. It
        is a cartilaginous structure in children and young adults, but it
        ossifies (hardens) with age. The xiphoid process is the site of
        attachment for the diaphragm and the rectus abdominis muscles.
      </p>
      <p>[Image of Xiphoid process anatomy]</p>
      <p><strong>Functions of the sternum</strong></p>
      <p>The sternum has a number of important functions, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Protection:</strong> The sternum helps to protect the vital
          organs of the chest, including the heart, lungs, and major blood
          vessels.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Support:</strong> The sternum provides support for the rib
          cage and helps to maintain the shape of the chest.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Muscle attachment:</strong> The sternum is the site of
          attachment for a number of important muscles, including the pectoralis
          major, pectoralis minor, sternocleidomastoid, diaphragm, and rectus
          abdominis muscles.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Common injuries of the sternum</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fracture:</strong> A fracture of the sternum can occur due to
          a traumatic injury, such as a car accident or a fall from a height.

      <h4 id="key-concept-cardiothoracic-surgical-access">
        Key Concept: <strong>Cardiothoracic Surgical Access</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Cardiothoracic surgical access refers to the methods and approaches used
        by surgeons to gain access to the heart and surrounding structures
        within the thoracic cavity. The choice of surgical access is determined
        by various factors, including the type of cardiac surgery being
        performed, the patient's anatomy, and the surgeon's expertise. Below are
        some of the common approaches used in cardiothoracic surgery:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="../../static/img/cardiac_approaches.png" alt="approaches" />
      </p>
      <p><strong>1. Sternotomy</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Process:</strong> A full sternotomy involves making a
            vertical incision along the midline of the chest, followed by the
            division of the sternum, to provide wide access to the heart and
            lungs.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Usage:</strong> This approach is commonly used for various
            cardiac surgeries, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG),
            valve replacements, and heart transplants.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Advantages:</strong> It provides extensive visibility and
            access to the thoracic structures.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> It involves a larger incision and
            can be associated with more pain and a longer recovery period
            post-surgery.
          </p>
          <p>

            />
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In a standard procedure, following the sternotomy, the sternum is
        divided using a sternal saw. The sternum is then retracted using a
        sternal retractor. The surgeon dissects down to the pericardium, which
        is a fibrous sac that surrounds the heart. The pericardium is opened and
        retracted using a "stay" suture (<em>seen in image below</em>) for
        visaibility and access to the heart. The surgeon then performs the
        surgical procedure on the heart. Following the procedure, the
        pericardium is closed, the sternum is approximated, and the sternum is
        closed using sternal closure wires, cables, or plates.

      <p><strong>2. Partial or Mini-Sternotomy:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Process:</strong> A partial or mini-sternotomy involves
            making a smaller incision and dividing only a portion of the
            sternum, either the upper or lower part.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Usage:</strong> It is often utilized for minimally invasive
            valve surgery or CABG.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Advantages:</strong> It is associated with less pain,
            reduced blood loss, and a shorter recovery period compared to a full
            sternotomy.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> It may provide limited visibility
            and access compared to a full sternotomy.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>

      <p><strong>3. Mini-Thoracotomy</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Process:</strong> A mini-thoracotomy involves making a small
            incision between the ribs, without dividing the sternum, to access
            the heart.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Usage:</strong> This approach is commonly used for minimally
            invasive valve surgeries, particularly for the aortic and mitral
            valves.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Advantages:</strong> It is associated with less pain and a
            quicker recovery compared to a sternotomy. It also avoids the need
            to divide the sternum.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> It provides limited access and
            visibility, and may not be suitable for more complex cardiac
            procedures.
          </p>
          <p>

            />
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Considerations for Surgical Access</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Patient Factors:</strong> The patient’s anatomy, medical
          history, and the presence of any co-morbidities are considered when
          choosing the surgical approach.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Surgical Factors:</strong> The type of surgery, the need for
          visibility and access, and the surgeon’s expertise influence the
          choice of access.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recovery:</strong> Minimally invasive approaches tend to be
          associated with less pain and a quicker recovery, but are not suitable
          for all types of surgeries.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In conclusion, the choice of cardiothoracic surgical access is
        multifaceted and tailored to each individual patient and surgical
        procedure. The surgeon will weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each
        approach to determine the most suitable method of access.

        Key Concept: Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting (EVH)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting (EVH) is a minimally invasive technique
        used to harvest the saphenous vein for use as a graft in coronary artery
        bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. EVH is a preferred alternative to the
        traditional open vein harvesting (OVH) technique, which involves making
        a long incision along the length of the leg to access the saphenous vein
        (<em
          >everything I have ever seen has has been EVH. If the team has trouble
          getting the vein they switch to another vessel before pursuing an open

        <li>
          <strong>Accessing the Saphenous Vein:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Physicians Assistant (PA) makes a small incision in the leg,
              usually in the groin or the knee, to access the saphenous vein.
            </li>
            <li>
              A special endoscopic device is inserted through the incision and
              guided along the length of the vein.
            </li>
            <li>
              The endoscope provides a magnified view of the vein and
              surrounding tissue, allowing the surgeon to identify and isolate
              the saphenous vein.

        Key Concept: Internal Mammory Artery (IMA):
      </h4>
      <p>
        The <strong>Internal Mammary Artery (IMA)</strong> is commonly used in
        Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) surgery, which aims to restore
        blood flow to the heart muscle when the coronary arteries are obstructed
        due to coronary artery disease.
      </p>
      <h5 id="why-ima-in-cabg">Why IMA in CABG:</h5>
      <p>
        The IMA is a preferred vessel for grafting due to its proven long-term
        patency and positive clinical outcomes in CABG patients. When used as a
        graft, the IMA has demonstrated a better resistance to atherosclerosis
        and a longer survival rate compared to other graft types, such as
        saphenous vein grafts.
      </p>
      <p><img src="../../static/img/ima.png" alt="ima" /></p>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Harvesting the IMA:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The surgeon usually accesses the IMA through a median sternotomy,
              where the sternum is split open to provide access to the heart and
              the internal mammary artery.
            </li>
            <li>
              The left internal mammary artery (LIMA) is most commonly used,
              although the right IMA can also be utilized depending on the
              surgeon's preference and the patient's anatomy.
            </li>
            <li>
              The IMA is carefully dissected and released from its position
              alongside the inside of the chest wall.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Choosing the Target Vessel:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The surgeon identifies which of the coronary arteries will be
              bypassed. The choice often falls on the left anterior descending
              artery (LAD) if the LIMA is used due to its proximity and superior
              long-term patency rates.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Performing the Bypass:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The distal end of the harvested IMA is attached to the identified
              coronary artery beyond the site of the blockage.
            </li>
            <li>
              The proximal end of the IMA (closer to the origin of the artery)
              is left attached to the subclavian artery, providing blood flow to
              the graft and subsequently to the coronary artery.
            </li>
            <li>
              Through this bypass, the blood can flow around the blocked segment
              of the coronary artery, thus re-establishing perfusion to the
              heart muscle.

        Key Concept: Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB)
      </h4>
      <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
      <p>
        Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), often referred to as heart-lung bypass, is
        a fundamental technique in cardiac surgery, facilitating a still and
        bloodless operative field. It performs the physiological roles of the
        heart and lungs, thereby permitting surgeons to operate on the heart
        while normal circulatory and respiratory functions are suspended. This
        document elucidates the principles, mechanics, and considerations
        related to CPB within the context of open-heart surgery.

      </h4>
      <p>
        Femoral access, particularly femoral cannulation, is a pivotal technique
        in open heart surgeries and procedures that require cardiopulmonary
        bypass (CPB). This approach allows for the circulation of blood via a
        heart-lung machine, bypassing the heart and maintaining perfusion to the
        rest of the body during surgery. It is often utilized in various cardiac
        interventions, including certain open heart surgeries, where direct
        aortic cannulation might be contraindicated or high-risk.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Positioning:</strong> The patient is placed in a supine
              position, ensuring comfortable and safe access to the femoral
              region.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sterilization:</strong> The groin area is cleaned and
              sterilized to prevent infection.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Anesthesia:</strong> Local or general anesthesia is
              administered based on the procedure.

          <p><strong>Femoral Vessel Access:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Exposure:</strong> The femoral artery and vein are exposed
              via a small incision in the groin area.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cannulation:</strong> Cannulas are inserted into the
              femoral artery and vein. The arterial cannula is utilized to
              deliver oxygenated blood from the heart-lung machine to the
              systemic circulation, while the venous cannula drains deoxygenated
              blood from the body to the machine.

          <p><strong>Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Initiation:</strong> Once cannulation is secured, CPB is
              initiated, diverting blood away from the heart and lungs, allowing
              for a still and bloodless surgical field.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Maintenance:</strong> The patient’s hemodynamics,
              including blood pressure, oxygenation, and acid-base balance, are
              meticulously monitored and managed during CPB.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Intervention:</strong> With the heart isolated from the
              systemic circulation, surgical interventions, such as valve
              repairs or coronary bypass, are performed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>De-airing:</strong> Before weaning from CPB, the heart is
              de-aired to prevent air embolism.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

          <p><strong>Decannulation and Closure:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Weaning from CPB:</strong> The patient is gradually weaned
              off the heart-lung machine, and the heart resumes its function.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Decannulation:</strong> The cannulas are removed, and the
              femoral vessels are repaired, typically with sutures.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Closure:</strong> The incision is closed meticulously to
              minimize infection risk and ensure optimal healing.

      </h4>
      <p>
        Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) is a surgical procedure aimed at
        improving blood flow to the myocardium by bypassing occluded coronary
        arteries. This is achieved by creating new pathways for blood flow using
        grafts, which are often vessels harvested from other parts of the
        patient's body. The process of attaching the graft involves creating
        connections, or anastomoses, at two points: proximal and distal to the
        occlusion.

      <p><strong>1. Proximal Anastomosis</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Proximal anastomosis refers to the
            connection of the graft to a major artery, which is typically the
            aorta, to ensure a robust and oxygen-rich blood supply to the graft.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Location Identification:</strong> A suitable site on the
              aorta is identified for anastomosis.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Arteriotomy:</strong> A small incision is made in the wall
              of the aorta, often using a surgical aortic punch.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Graft Attachment:</strong> The graft (like the saphenous
              vein) is sutured to the aorta, establishing the proximal
              anastomosis.

            <li>
              <strong>Aortic Health:</strong> The health and calcification level
              of the aorta must be considered to ensure a secure anastomosis.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> Distal anastomosis involves connecting
            the other end of the graft to the coronary artery, beyond the point
            of occlusion, to restore blood flow to the myocardium.
          </p>

        require surgical precision and expertise to ensure the successful
        re-establishment of blood flow to the myocardium, thereby enhancing
        cardiac function and patient outcomes. The procedure demands meticulous
        planning, technical proficiency, and comprehensive postoperative
        management to optimize long-term graft patency and overall cardiac
        health.

        Key Concept:
        <strong>Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass (OPCAB) Procedures</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass (OPCAB), often referred to as "beating
        heart surgery," is a technique of performing coronary artery bypass
        grafting (CABG) without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) – the
        heart-lung machine. This approach allows surgeons to perform bypass
        surgery while the heart is still beating, thereby avoiding potential
        complications associated with CPB. Typically the perfusion team is still
        there, on site, ready to go on pump if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most common consideration for doing an off-pump CABG is due to heavy
        calcification in the Aorta. The surgeon factors that variable in,
        amongst a host of others, and makes a decsision. Sometimes the risk of
        calcium embolism is too high and the surgeon will opt for an off-pump
        CABG. An embolism occures wehn a piece of calcium breaks off and travels
        to the brain or other organs. This can cause a stroke or other ischemic
        complications.

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stabilization:</strong> A stabilizer is used to steady the
              portion of the heart where the grafting is to be performed, while
              the rest of the heart continues to beat and circulate blood.

      <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Reduced Complications:</strong> OPCAB often associates with
          fewer neurological complications, less renal impairment, and lower
          mortality in specific patient subsets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoidance of CPB:</strong> Eliminates complications related to
          the use of the heart-lung machine, such as systemic inflammatory
          response and potential air or particle embolism.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shorter Recovery:</strong> Often, patients experience a
          quicker recovery and shorter hospital stay compared to on-pump CABG.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Challenges and Risks</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical Difficulty:</strong> Performing anastomoses on a
          beating heart demands high surgical skill and expertise.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited Revascularization:</strong> In some cases, it might be
          challenging to achieve complete revascularization, especially in
          patients with multiple vessel disease.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hemodynamic Instability:</strong> Manipulating the heart
          during surgery can sometimes lead to hemodynamic instability, which
          must be meticulously managed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Patient Selection:</strong> Careful selection of suitable
          candidates for OPCAB is crucial to optimize outcomes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Surgical Expertise:</strong> Surgeons must be adept at
          performing precise anastomoses on the beating heart.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Intraoperative Management:</strong> Ensuring stable
          hemodynamics and adequate myocardial protection during the procedure.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In summary, OPCAB offers a viable alternative to conventional on-pump
        CABG, particularly for certain patient populations, providing the
        benefits of reduced complications and quicker recovery. The approach,
        while technically demanding, can yield excellent outcomes with
        meticulous surgical technique, thorough patient selection, and
        comprehensive intraoperative management.

      <h4 id="key-concept-temporary-pacing">Key Concept: Temporary Pacing</h4>
      <p>
        Temporary pacing involves the insertion of a pacing wire into the heart
        to regulate the heart rate. It is a common procedure in cardiac surgery,
        where it is used to maintain a normal heart rate during and after
        surgery.
      </p>
      <h5 id="why-temporary-pacing-is-used-in-cardiac-surgery">
        Why Temporary Pacing is used in Cardiac Surgery:
      </h5>
      <p>
        Temporary pacing is used in cardiac surgery to maintain a normal heart
        rate during and after surgery. It is often used in conjunction with
        cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), which is a technique that temporarily
        takes over the function of the heart and lungs during surgery. CPB is
        used in cardiac surgery to provide a still and bloodless operative
        field, facilitating the surgical procedure. However, CPB can cause
        arrhythmias, which are abnormal heart rhythms. Temporary pacing is used
        to regulate the heart rate and prevent arrhythmias during and after CPB.
      </p>
      <h5 id="atrial-pacing-vs-ventricular-pacing">
        Atrial Pacing vs. Ventricular Pacing:
      </h5>
      <p>
        <strong>Atrial Pacing Wires</strong> - are typically placed epicardially
        on the right atrium. They are used to pace the atrium, which is the
        upper chamber of the heart. Atrial pacing wires are used to maintain a
        normal heart rate during and after surgery. Many surgeons are more
        selective on the utilization of atrial pacing, and often only use atrial
        pacing on a patient who is "pacing dependent". That said, other surgeons
        use atrial pacing wires in their standard protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="../../static/img/atrial_pacing.png" alt="atrial pacing" />
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ventricular Pacing Wires</strong> - are typically placed in the
        myocardium of the right ventricle. They are used to pace the ventricle,
        which is the lower chamber of the heart. Ventricular pacing wires are
        used to maintain a normal heart rate during and after surgery.
        Ventricular pacing is more commonly used than atrial pacing, as it is
        more effective at maintaining a normal heart rate.

      <h4 id="key-concept-hemostasis-products-used-in-cardiac-surgery">
        Key Concept: Hemostasis Products used in Cardiac Surgery
      </h4>
      <p>
        Hemostasis is a very complex topic. It is not an immediate focus of our
        current products, but should be understood at the surface level to
        understand what is happening in the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        The patient is often given a dose of Heparin to prevent blood clots from
        forming during the procedure. This is a very important step. The patient
        is then given a dose of Protamine to reverse the effects of the Heparin.
      </p>
      <p>
        The nuance and complexities of the patient and the case can cause
        bleeding issues sometimes with patients. Depending on the severity,
        different products are used to assist with hemostasis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blood products from the OR blood bank are often used to assist with
        hemostasis. These will often be units of blood, platelets, and less
        frequently factor 7 (a specific catalyst in the clotting cascade).
      </p>
      <p>
        Other products used to assist with hemostasis are topical hemostatic
        agents. These are products that are applied to the surgical site to
        assist with hemostasis. These products are often used in conjunction
        with the blood products from the blood bank.

          >Post-Operative Drainage in Cardiac Surgery - Chest Tubes</strong
        >
      </h4>
      <p>
        Following a cardiac operation, chest tubes are often placed to drain
        fluid and air from the chest cavity. Chest tubes are typically connected
        to a drainage system, which allows for the collection of fluid and air
        from the chest cavity. The drainage system is often connected to a
        suction device, which helps to remove fluid and air from the chest
        cavity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tubes are placed in the chest cavity near the end of the procedure, the
        one end of the tube being passed through the pateints skin.

        Key Concept: <strong>Sternal Closure in Cardiac Surgery</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Sternal closure is a critical phase in cardiac surgery, following
        intrathoracic procedures, where the sternum, which has been surgically
        divided or entered, is securely closed to ensure stability, promote
        healing, and prevent complications. This process is vital for protecting
        underlying structures like the heart and lungs and providing structural
        integrity during the recovery period.

        Key Concept:
        <strong>Aortic Dissections &amp; Induced Hypothermia</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Aortic dissection is a serious condition where the inner layer of the
        aorta tears, allowing blood to flow between the layers of the aortic
        wall, forcing the layers apart. In the context of surgical repair of
        aortic dissections, induced hypothermia is often utilized as a
        protective strategy to safeguard organ function, particularly the brain
        and spinal cord, during periods of reduced or interrupted blood flow.
