### Surgical Interventions in Cardiac Diseases: CABG, Valve Replacements, Transcatheter Interventions

The realm of cardiac surgery has evolved significantly, with a spectrum of surgical interventions available to manage and treat various cardiac diseases. In this module, we will delve into three pivotal procedures: Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), Valve Replacements, and Transcatheter Interventions.

1. **Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)**:
    - **Objective**: CABG aims to restore blood flow to ischemic myocardium by bypassing obstructed coronary arteries.
    - **Procedure**:
        - Autologous vessels, usually the internal mammary artery or saphenous vein, are harvested.
        - The patient is often placed on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
        - The harvested vessel is grafted to the aorta and the site past the obstruction, bypassing the stenotic areas.
    - **Indications**: Significant obstruction in the coronary arteries, particularly in patients with left main coronary disease or severe triple-vessel disease.
    - **Outcomes**: CABG has been shown to improve survival and quality of life in individuals with advanced coronary artery disease.

1. **Valve Replacements & Repairs**:
    - **Objective**: To replace dysfunctional heart valves that are either stenotic or regurgitant, restoring normal hemodynamics.
    - **Procedure**:
        - **Mechanical Valves**: Known for durability but require lifelong anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic events.
        - **Bioprosthetic Valves**: Have lower thrombogenicity but are less durable than mechanical valves.
        - **Valve Repair**: Involves various techniques to repair the native valve, such as commissurotomy, annuloplasty, or chordal reconstruction.
    - **Indications**: Severe valvular stenosis or regurgitation affecting the patient's quality of life and cardiac function.
    - **Outcomes**: Valve replacements significantly alleviate symptoms and improve survival, although they may require re-operation over time, especially bioprosthetic valves.

1. **Transcatheter Interventions**:
    - **Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)**:
        - **Objective**: A less invasive alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement, especially beneficial for high-risk surgical candidates.
        - **Procedure**: A bioprosthetic valve is delivered via a catheter, usually through the femoral artery, and is deployed in the position of the native aortic valve.
  ![tavr](../../static/img/tavr.png)
    - **Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair (TMVr)**:
        - **Objective**: To repair the mitral valve in a less invasive manner compared to traditional surgery.
        - **Procedure**: Devices like the MitraClip are utilized to create a double-orifice valve, improving leaflet coaptation and reducing regurgitation.
    - **Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI)**:
        - **Objective**: To alleviate coronary artery obstructions, improving myocardial perfusion.
        - **Procedure**: A stent is delivered to the site of obstruction and deployed to keep the artery open.
  

4. **Post-operative Care**:
    - **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring in the initial post-operative period is essential to identify and manage complications like arrhythmias, infections, or bleeding.
    - **Rehabilitation**: Cardiac rehabilitation is pivotal for optimizing recovery, educating the patient on lifestyle modifications, and monitoring for any signs of disease recurrence or post-operative complications.

5. **Ethical Considerations**:
    - Informed consent, patient education about the risks, benefits, and alternatives are essential components of pre-operative planning.

6. **Future Trends**:
    - The advent of minimally invasive surgical techniques, robotic-assisted surgeries, and continuous advancements in transcatheter interventions herald an exciting era in cardiac surgery.

Understanding the intricacies, indications, and outcomes of these surgical interventions is foundational for future learning.

#### Key Concept: **Anatomy of the Sternum**

The sternum, also known as the breastbone, is a flat bone that forms the anterior portion of the chest wall. It is a T-shaped bone that is divided into three parts: the manubrium, the body, and the xiphoid process.

![stenrum](../../static/img/sternum_anterior_overview.png)

**Manubrium**

The manubrium is the broad, superior segment of the sternum. It articulates with the clavicles at the sternoclavicular joints and with the costal cartilages of the first pair of ribs. The manubrium also has a number of important landmarks, including the jugular notch, which is located at the superior margin of the manubrium and lies between the two clavicles.

![sternum manubrium anatomy](../../static/img/sternum_side_profile.png)

**Body**

The body of the sternum is the middle portion of the bone. It articulates with the costal cartilages of the second to seventh pairs of ribs. The body of the sternum is also the site of attachment for a number of muscles, including the pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, and sternocleidomastoid muscles.

![sternum with ribs](../../static/img/sternum_with_ribs.png)

**Xiphoid process**

The xiphoid process is the narrow, inferior segment of the sternum. It is a cartilaginous structure in children and young adults, but it ossifies (hardens) with age. The xiphoid process is the site of attachment for the diaphragm and the rectus abdominis muscles.

**Functions of the sternum**

The sternum has a number of important functions, including:

* **Protection:** The sternum helps to protect the vital organs of the chest, including the heart, lungs, and major blood vessels.
* **Support:** The sternum provides support for the rib cage and helps to maintain the shape of the chest.
* **Muscle attachment:** The sternum is the site of attachment for a number of important muscles, including the pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, sternocleidomastoid, diaphragm, and rectus abdominis muscles.

**Common injuries of the sternum**

* **Fracture:** A fracture of the sternum can occur due to a traumatic injury, such as a car accident or a fall from a height.

#### Key Concept: Temporary Pacing

Temporary pacing involves the insertion of a pacing wire into the heart to regulate the heart rate. It is a common procedure in cardiac surgery, where it is used to maintain a normal heart rate during and after surgery.

##### Why Temporary Pacing is used in Cardiac Surgery:

Temporary pacing is used in cardiac surgery to maintain a normal heart rate during and after surgery. It is often used in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), which is a technique that temporarily takes over the function of the heart and lungs during surgery. CPB is used in cardiac surgery to provide a still and bloodless operative field, facilitating the surgical procedure. However, CPB can cause arrhythmias, which are abnormal heart rhythms. Temporary pacing is used to regulate the heart rate and prevent arrhythmias during and after CPB.

##### Atrial Pacing vs. Ventricular Pacing:

**Atrial Pacing Wires** - are typically placed epicardially on the right atrium. They are used to pace the atrium, which is the upper chamber of the heart. Atrial pacing wires are used to maintain a normal heart rate during and after surgery. Many surgeons are more selective on the utilization of atrial pacing, and often only use atrial pacing on a patient who is "pacing dependent". That said, other surgeons use atrial pacing wires in their standard protocol.

![atrial pacing](../../static/img/atrial_pacing.png)

**Ventricular Pacing Wires** - are typically placed in the myocardium of the right ventricle. They are used to pace the ventricle, which is the lower chamber of the heart. Ventricular pacing wires are used to maintain a normal heart rate during and after surgery. Ventricular pacing is more commonly used than atrial pacing, as it is more effective at maintaining a normal heart rate.

#### Key Concept: Internal Mammory Artery (IMA):

The **Internal Mammary Artery (IMA)** is commonly used in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) surgery, which aims to restore blood flow to the heart muscle when the coronary arteries are obstructed due to coronary artery disease.

##### Why IMA in CABG:
The IMA is a preferred vessel for grafting due to its proven long-term patency and positive clinical outcomes in CABG patients. When used as a graft, the IMA has demonstrated a better resistance to atherosclerosis and a longer survival rate compared to other graft types, such as saphenous vein grafts.

![ima](../../static/img/ima.png)

##### How IMA is used in CABG:

1. **Harvesting the IMA:**
   - The surgeon usually accesses the IMA through a median sternotomy, where the sternum is split open to provide access to the heart and the internal mammary artery.
   - The left internal mammary artery (LIMA) is most commonly used, although the right IMA can also be utilized depending on the surgeon's preference and the patient's anatomy.
   - The IMA is carefully dissected and released from its position alongside the inside of the chest wall.

2. **Choosing the Target Vessel:**
   - The surgeon identifies which of the coronary arteries will be bypassed. The choice often falls on the left anterior descending artery (LAD) if the LIMA is used due to its proximity and superior long-term patency rates.
   
3. **Performing the Bypass:**
   - The distal end of the harvested IMA is attached to the identified coronary artery beyond the site of the blockage.
   - The proximal end of the IMA (closer to the origin of the artery) is left attached to the subclavian artery, providing blood flow to the graft and subsequently to the coronary artery.
   - Through this bypass, the blood can flow around the blocked segment of the coronary artery, thus re-establishing perfusion to the heart muscle.

![ima bypass](../../static/img/ima_graft.png)

##### Advantages of using the IMA in CABG:

- **Superior Patency Rates:** IMA grafts tend to remain open and functional for a longer time compared to saphenous vein grafts.
- **Reduced Atherosclerosis:** The IMA is less prone to developing atherosclerosis, which is a common cause of graft failure.
- **Improved Survival:** Several studies have demonstrated improved long-term survival in patients who received an IMA graft during CABG.

#### Key Concept: Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting (EVH)

Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting (EVH) is a minimally invasive technique used to harvest the saphenous vein for use as a graft in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. EVH is a preferred alternative to the traditional open vein harvesting (OVH) technique, which involves making a long incision along the length of the leg to access the saphenous vein (_everything I have ever seen has has been EVH. If the team has trouble getting the vein they switch to another vessel before pursuing an open harvest_).

##### How the EVH is performed in a CABG:

1. **Accessing the Saphenous Vein:**
   - The surgeon makes a small incision in the leg, usually in the groin or the knee, to access the saphenous vein.
   - A special endoscopic device is inserted through the incision and guided along the length of the vein.
   - The endoscope provides a magnified view of the vein and surrounding tissue, allowing the surgeon to identify and isolate the saphenous vein.

#### Key Concept: Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB)

**Introduction**

Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), often referred to as heart-lung bypass, is a fundamental technique in cardiac surgery, facilitating a still and bloodless operative field. It performs the physiological roles of the heart and lungs, thereby permitting surgeons to operate on the heart while normal circulatory and respiratory functions are suspended. This document elucidates the principles, mechanics, and considerations related to CPB within the context of open-heart surgery.

##### 1. The Mechanism of Cardiopulmonary Bypass

- **Primary Components**
    - **Oxygenator**: Replaces pulmonary function by oxygenating blood and removing carbon dioxide.
      ![oxygenator](../../static/img/oxygenator.png)
    - **Pump**: Mimics the heart by propelling blood through the CPB circuit and into the patient’s circulatory system.
      ![pump](../../static/img/cp_pump.png)
    - **Heat Exchanger**: Regulates the patient’s temperature during surgery, which may involve hypothermic techniques.
- **Functionality**
    - Blood is diverted from the heart to the CPB machine.
    - The pump propels the blood through the oxygenator and back into the patient’s circulation, bypassing the heart and lungs.
    
##### 2. Implementation of Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Surgery

- **Initiation**
    - Cannulation of the major vessels, typically the aorta and venae cavae, to divert blood from the heart.
    - Heparin is administered to prevent coagulation.
      ![cannulation](../../static/img/cannulation.png)
- **Maintenance**
    - Constant monitoring of parameters such as blood pressure, temperature, and oxygenation is crucial.
    - Hemodilution and temperature management strategies are employed to protect organs during the bypass.
- **Termination**
    - Gradual weaning off CPB while restoring independent cardiac function.
    - Reversal of anticoagulation, frequently using protamine.
    
##### 3. Open-Heart Surgery: Synchronized with CPB

- **Valve Surgeries and Repairs**
    - Facilitates operations on valves, enabling repairs or replacements.
- **Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)**
    - Allows for the grafting of vessels to bypass coronary obstructions without the interference of circulating blood.
- **Congenital Defect Repairs**
    - Vital for addressing structural heart defects present from birth.
- **Heart Transplant**
    - A pivotal role in maintaining systemic perfusion during organ replacement.
    
##### 4. Physiological and Pathophysiological Considerations

- **Systemic Inflammatory Response**
    - CPB can induce an inflammatory response, implicating in post-operative complications.
- **Organ Perfusion**
    - Adequate perfusion and oxygenation of vital organs must be meticulously managed.
- **Coagulation**
    - The management of hemostasis and coagulation is paramount to prevent excessive bleeding or thrombotic events.

#### Key Concept: Cardioplegia

**Introduction**

Cardioplegia is a technique used in cardiac surgery to induce cardiac arrest, allowing surgeons to operate on a still heart. This document elucidates the principles, mechanics, and considerations related to cardioplegia within the context of open-heart surgery.

##### 1. The Mechanism of Cardioplegia

- **Primary Components**
    - **Cardioplegic Solution**: A specialized solution that is infused into the heart to induce cardiac arrest.
    - **Delivery System**: A device that delivers the cardioplegic solution to the heart.

##### 2. Implementation of Cardioplegia in Surgery

- **Initiation**
    - The delivery system is connected to the heart, and the cardioplegic solution is infused.
    - The heart is arrested, and the surgeon can operate on a still heart.

##### 3. Antegrade vs. Retrograde Cardioplegia

- **Antegrade Cardioplegia**
    - The cardioplegic solution is infused into the coronary arteries, usually via the aortic root.
    - The solution flows in the same direction as the blood, hence the term “antegrade.”  

![antegrade](../../static/img/antegrade.png)

- **Retrograde Cardioplegia**
    - The cardioplegic solution is infused into the coronary sinus, which is located on the posterior side of the heart.
    - The solution flows in the opposite direction of the blood, hence the term “retrograde.”

![retrograde](../../static/img/retrograde.png)
![plegia](../../static/img/plegia.png)

##### 4. Physiological and Pathophysiological Considerations

- **Myocardial Protection**
    - Cardioplegia protects the myocardium from ischemic damage during cardiac arrest.

##### 5. Components of Cardioplegic Solution

- **Potassium**
    - Potassium is the primary component of cardioplegic solution, as it is the primary ion responsible for depolarization of cardiac cells.
  - **Magnesium**
    - Magnesium is often added to cardioplegic solution, as it enhances the effects of potassium.
  - **Other Components**
    - Other components of cardioplegic solution include calcium, sodium, and glucose.
  - **Blood**
    - Blood is often added to cardioplegic solution to provide oxygen to the myocardium during cardiac arrest.
