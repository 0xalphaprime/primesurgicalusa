### Prime Surgical Cardiac Portfolio in Action


_NOTE: This is meant to be an example, showing how a surgeon could proceed (in part) with a procedure. There is a lot of nuance that I am not able to capture below. This is meant to help your framing of the producs we sell through a live OR setting._

`all blocks formatted like this below are product categories currently sold by Prime Surgical through our various Device Manufacturer partners`

**Sternotomy** - The case begins with the patient supine on the OR Table, prepped and drapped, with arms abducted. A midline incision is made in the chest wall, extending from the suprasternal notch to the xiphoid process. The subcutaneous tissues and pectoralis major muscles are dissected, exposing the sternum. The sternum is then divided at the midline using a saw, and the two halves are retracted using sternal retractors. 


**Dissection & Exposure** - The pericardium is opened, and the heart is exposed via blunt dissection. The pericardium is then retracted using pericardial stay sutures. The diseased coronary arteries are identified, and the heart is prepared for cardiopulmonary bypass. If the surgeon is using an aterial graft, (often the left internal mammary artery), the LIMA is harvested at this time. The IMA arteries run along the inside of the chest wall, and are often used as a graft for CABG. Specialized instrumentation is used to harvest the IMA(s) - delicate `forceps` and `scissors` are used to dissect the IMA from the chest wall. The IMA is then clamped off (temporarily) using a `single-use bulldog clamp` until it is ready to be grafted.


**Cardiopulmonary Bypass** - The patient is then placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. Bypass is acheived using an `arterial cannula` and a `venous cannula` as a circuit to the heart-lung machine. The heart is arrested and protected using cardioplegia, which can be delived as antegrate cardioplegia or `retrograde cardioplegia`. 


**The Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)** - The diseased coronary arteries are bypassed using autologous (from one's own body) vessels. This is most often done by taking the saphenous vein out of the patient at the start of the case. When you hear "vein graft" it is referring to a saphenous vein. In younger patients, and for other clinical considerations, arterial grafts are preferred, as their long-term patency performs better than veins. For vein grafts, the surgeon performs a distal coronary anastamoses with his `distal coronary needle holder` and his proximal anastamoses with his `proximal coronary needle holder`. For an IMA graft the surgoen only performs a distal anastamoses (as the proximal is still attached to arterial flow). For proximal anastamoses the surgeon uses a `punch` to make a circular sewing site in the aorta. The blood then moves from the aorta, through the graft, and into the coronary artery downstream of the blockage. 


**Coming Off Pump** - The heart is then defibrillated, and the patient is weaned off CPB. Often times, the surgeon will use a temporary pacing wire to help pace the heart as it comes off pump. Most often surgeons use `ventricular pacing wires`, while the use of `atrial pacing wires` is more selective.
