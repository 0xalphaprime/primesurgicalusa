        A large part of the Zimmer portfolio comes from the broader category of
        <code>sternal closure</code>, which is the process of closing the
        sternum after a sternotomy. A sternotomy is a surgical procedure that
        involves cutting through the sternum (breastbone) to access the thoracic
        cavity. This is a common procedure for heart surgery, and is the most
        commonly done with a CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting).
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditionally, cardiac surgeons used stainless steel sternal wires to
        close the sternum. More recently, new technologies have been released to
        optimize the patients recovery, and reduce the risk of complications.
        These new technologies include <code>sternal plating systems</code>,
        <code>sternal cable systems</code>, and <code>double wire</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionaly, the growing portfolio includes a number of single-use
        items, such as <code>atrial and ventricular pacing wires</code>,
        <code>temporary pacing cables</code>, and a <code>punch</code>.

        Key Concept: <strong>Cardiothoracic Surgical Access</strong>
      </h5>
      <p>
        Cardiothoracic surgical access refers to the methods and approaches used
        by surgeons to gain access to the heart and surrounding structures
        within the thoracic cavity. The choice of surgical access is determined
        by various factors, including the type of cardiac surgery being
        performed, the patient's anatomy, and the surgeon's expertise. Below are
        some of the common approaches used in cardiothoracic surgery:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="../../static/img/cardiac_approaches.png" alt="approaches" />
      </p>
      <p><strong>1. Sternotomy</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Process:</strong> A full sternotomy involves making a vertical
          incision along the midline of the chest, followed by the division of
          the sternum, to provide wide access to the heart and lungs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage:</strong> This approach is commonly used for various
          cardiac surgeries, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG),
          valve replacements, and heart transplants.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Advantages:</strong> It provides extensive visibility and
          access to the thoracic structures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> It involves a larger incision and can
          be associated with more pain and a longer recovery period
          post-surgery.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <img
          src="../../static/img/full_sternotomy.png"
          alt="Full Sternotomy"
        /><br />
        <img src="../../static/img/full_sternotomy_2.png" alt="Sternotomy" />
      </p>
      <p>
        In a standard procedure, following the sternotomy, the sternum is
        divided using a sternal saw. The sternum is then retracted using a
        sternal retractor. The surgeon dissects down to the pericardium, which
        is a fibrous sac that surrounds the heart. The pericardium is opened and
        retracted using a "stay" suture (<em>seen in image below</em>) for
        visaibility and access to the heart. The surgeon then performs the
        surgical procedure on the heart. Following the procedure, the
        pericardium is closed, the sternum is approximated, and the sternum is
        closed using sternal closure wires, cables, or plates.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="../../static/img/full_sternotomy_3.png" alt="Sternotomy" />
      </p>
      <p><strong>2. Partial or Mini-Sternotomy:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Process:</strong> A partial or mini-sternotomy involves making
          a smaller incision and dividing only a portion of the sternum, either
          the upper or lower part.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage:</strong> It is often utilized for minimally invasive
          valve surgery or CABG.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Advantages:</strong> It is associated with less pain, reduced
          blood loss, and a shorter recovery period compared to a full
          sternotomy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> It may provide limited visibility and
          access compared to a full sternotomy.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Types:</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <img src="../../static/img/mini_sternotomy.png" alt="Mini Sternotomy" />
      </p>
      <p><strong>3. Mini-Thoracotomy</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Process:</strong> A mini-thoracotomy involves making a small
            incision between the ribs, without dividing the sternum, to access
            the heart.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Usage:</strong> This approach is commonly used for minimally
            invasive valve surgeries, particularly for the aortic and mitral
            valves.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Advantages:</strong> It is associated with less pain and a
            quicker recovery compared to a sternotomy. It also avoids the need
            to divide the sternum.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> It provides limited access and
            visibility, and may not be suitable for more complex cardiac
            procedures.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img

            />
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Considerations for Surgical Access</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Patient Factors:</strong> The patient’s anatomy, medical
          history, and the presence of any co-morbidities are considered when
          choosing the surgical approach.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Surgical Factors:</strong> The type of surgery, the need for
          visibility and access, and the surgeon’s expertise influence the
          choice of access.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recovery:</strong> Minimally invasive approaches tend to be
          associated with less pain and a quicker recovery, but are not suitable
          for all types of surgeries.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In conclusion, the choice of cardiothoracic surgical access is
        multifaceted and tailored to each individual patient and surgical
        procedure. The surgeon will weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each
        approach to determine the most suitable method of access.

        Key Concept: <strong>Anatomy of the Sternum</strong>
      </h5>
      <p>
        The sternum, also known as the breastbone, is a flat bone that forms the
        anterior portion of the chest wall. It is a T-shaped bone that is
        divided into three parts: the manubrium, the body, and the xiphoid
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="../../static/img/sternum_anterior_overview.png"
          alt="stenrum"
        />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Manubrium</strong></p>
      <p>
        The manubrium is the broad, superior segment of the sternum. It
        articulates with the clavicles at the sternoclavicular joints and with
        the costal cartilages of the first pair of ribs. The manubrium also has
        a number of important landmarks, including the jugular notch, which is
        located at the superior margin of the manubrium and lies between the two
        clavicles.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="../../static/img/sternum_side_profile.png"
          alt="sternum manubrium anatomy"
        />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Body</strong></p>
      <p>
        The body of the sternum is the middle portion of the bone. It
        articulates with the costal cartilages of the second to seventh pairs of
        ribs. The body of the sternum is also the site of attachment for a
        number of muscles, including the pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, and
        sternocleidomastoid muscles.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="../../static/img/sternum_with_ribs.png"
          alt="sternum with ribs"
        />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Xiphoid process</strong></p>
      <p>
        The xiphoid process is the narrow, inferior segment of the sternum. It
        is a cartilaginous structure in children and young adults, but it
        ossifies (hardens) with age. The xiphoid process is the site of
        attachment for the diaphragm and the rectus abdominis muscles.
      </p>
      <p>[Image of Xiphoid process anatomy]</p>
      <p><strong>Functions of the sternum</strong></p>
      <p>The sternum has a number of important functions, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Protection:</strong> The sternum helps to protect the vital
          organs of the chest, including the heart, lungs, and major blood
          vessels.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Support:</strong> The sternum provides support for the rib
          cage and helps to maintain the shape of the chest.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Muscle attachment:</strong> The sternum is the site of
          attachment for a number of important muscles, including the pectoralis
          major, pectoralis minor, sternocleidomastoid, diaphragm, and rectus
          abdominis muscles.

        Key Concept: <strong>Sternal Closure in Cardiac Surgery</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Sternal closure is a critical phase in cardiac surgery, following
        intrathoracic procedures, where the sternum, which has been surgically
        divided or entered, is securely closed to ensure stability, promote
        healing, and prevent complications. This process is vital for protecting
        underlying structures like the heart and lungs and providing structural
        integrity during the recovery period.

      </p>
      <p><strong>Procedure of Sternal Closure</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Alignment (Approximation):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Positioning:</strong> The two halves of the sternum are
              aligned accurately to ensure proper healing and to minimize the
              risk of non-union or malunion.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stability:</strong> Ensuring that the sternum is stable
              and that there is no excessive movement at the closure site.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Fixation:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Wire Placement:</strong> Traditional method. Stainless
              steel wires are commonly used to approximate and stabilize the
              sternum. The wires are passed around the sternum and tightened to
              secure the two halves together.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sternal Plating:</strong> More recently, additional
              fixation devices like sternal plates may be used, especially in
              patients with associated risk factors.

        Benefits of Sternal Plates in Cardiac Surgery
      </h5>
      <p>
        Sternal plates are utilized in cardiac surgery as a method for sternal
        closure and stabilization, particularly in situations where traditional
        wire closure may not be optimal. These plates, often made from titanium,
        are designed to provide rigid fixation of the sternum, facilitating
        healing and providing stability. Here are some of the notable benefits
        of using sternal plates:
      </p>
      <h5 id="1-enhanced-stability">1. Enhanced Stability</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Rigid Fixation:</strong> Sternal plates provide a more rigid
          fixation compared to wires, reducing sternal micromotion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Support:</strong> They offer robust structural support,
          especially in patients with compromised bone quality.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 id="2-improved-healing">2. Improved Healing</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Alignment:</strong> Plates ensure accurate alignment of the
          sternal edges, promoting optimal healing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reduced Stress:</strong> By providing stable fixation, sternal
          plates may reduce stress on the healing bone, minimizing the risk of
          non-union or malunion.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 id="3-reduced-post-operative-pain">3. Reduced Post-Operative Pain</h5>

      <h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
      <p>
        While sternal plates offer numerous benefits, especially in specific
        patient populations, it's crucial to weigh these against the potential
        risks and costs associated with their use. The decision to utilize
        sternal plates should be based on a comprehensive assessment of the
        patient’s risk factors, the surgical context, and the potential
        advantages they offer in each specific case.

      <p>
        <code>sternal plating</code> is the largest single category of the
        portfolio. Roughly 1.45M of the 2.2M in Zimmer Biomet revenue (2023
        expected) will come from that product category.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are very well penetrated in our market. That said there are still
        multiple vectors to outpace our expected level of growth. This will be

        If we are maximally effective, Prime Surgical will serve as a proxy for
        quality products in the cardiovascular space. We'll be known for
        delivering outstanding service, and in time becoming a trusted parter of
        the surgeons and teams that we work with. As we integrate further into
        the programs we serve, we'll be able to provide more value when the
        right opportunities present themselves. We're then able to sell that
        added value upstream to strategic device manufacturer parters to further
        drive our growth. I believe we can acheive this flywheel, and deliver
        value to all stakeholders.
      </p>
      <p>
        This next section will lay out the various products that make up our
        cardiac portfolio with Zimmer Biomet. We will then transtion to our
        framework on the sales process. High-level categories include (1)
        <strong>Targeting</strong>, (2)
        <strong>Sales Pipeline Execution</strong>, (3)
        <strong>Account Management</strong>, and (4)
        <strong>Processes &amp; Operations</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have 4 different sternal plating systems to position and sell,
        depending on the preference profile(s) of the stakeholders across each
        opportunity. Each of our systems have individual attributes that dictate
        which is the optimal system to position with a potential customer.
        Although it is fine to influence the process, the correct product needs
        to be presented to the correct surgeon if clearly deduced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our systems fall into two primary categories: (1)
        <strong>Anterior Rigid Fixation</strong> and (2)
        <strong>Rigid Fixation with Integrated Cerclage</strong>.
      </p>
      <h4 id="sternalock-blu">Sternalock Blu</h4>
      <p><strong>Anterior Rigid Fixation</strong></p>
      <p>
        Sternalock Blu is the original sternal plating product of Zimmer Biomer.
        This is the system that was utilizied in both the Restore Study and the
        Sternalock Blu Study. This tray also serves as the base tray and system
        for Sternalock 360 (covered below).
      </p>
      <p>
        Our other systems have attributres likely to speak to surgeon
        preferences. Sternalock Blu is the most basic system, and is the most
        likely to be utilized by a surgeon who is most concerned on pricing.

      <p><strong>Rigid Fixation with Integrated Cerclage</strong></p>
      <p>
        Sternalock 360 builds off of the Sternalock Blu system, utilizing the
        same tray and screws. The plates come in a kit of 3 plates, and is
        sterile packed. It is opened to the field when the surgeon signals they
        will be plating the sternum
      </p>
      <p>
        The system integrates a 360 degree cerclage, by engineering a titanium
        band into the plate. The system is optimized for patients with poor bone
        quality. The band diffuses the force across a larger surgace area,
        reducing the risk of sternal complications (like a wire tearing through
        the sturnum in recovery).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two additional instruments to be kept in the tray. These
        instruments are for the manubrium plate, specifically to punch through
        the manubrium, and to guide the needle from the posterior side of the
        sternum through to the anterior side.

      <p><strong>Rigid Fixation with Integrated Cerclage</strong></p>
      <p>
        Sternalock XP (formerly known as Thorecon) is our second system that
        integrates a cerclage into the plate. This system integrates an
        amorphous cable, which is designed to pass through the sternum and wrap
        around the posterior side of the sternum as a normal cable would. When
        the cable is tensioned the amorphous cable spreads out, widening the
        covered surface area and further diffusing the force. The cable passes
        through an open lumen in the plate, and is tensioned with a ratcheting
        mechanism. Once the sternum is approximated the set screw is tightened,
        locking the cable in place. The remaining cable is then cut off, and the
        plate is secured with the remaining screws.
